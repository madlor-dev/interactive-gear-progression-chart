## Introduction

Ironman mode in Old School RuneScape (OSRS) offers a challenging experience where players are entirely self-sufficient, unable to trade with others. This gear progression chart is designed to guide Ironman players through an optimal path of gear and skill upgrades, enhancing their gameplay and progression.

The chart is interactive, allowing players to track their progress by marking items and skills they've acquired. It provides a visual representation of the recommended order in which to obtain gear and unlocks, helping players plan their journey effectively.

## Features

- **Interactive Tracking**: Click on items and skills to mark them as acquired, which will be saved locally on your browser.
- **Visual Progression Path**: A clear, visual representation of the suggested gear and skill acquisition sequence.
- **Easy to Use**: Simply open the HTML file in your browser to start using the chart.
- **Persistent State**: Your progress is saved locally, so you can return to the chart without losing your tracked items.
- **Tailored for Ironman**: Specifically designed with the Ironman gameplay style in mind.

## Usage
